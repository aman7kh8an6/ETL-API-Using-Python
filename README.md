# ETL-API-Using-Python
Extract Random Jokes via API and Load Into BigQuery using Python


Hereâ€™s what I've done in this project:
-Got a random joke from the API
-Parsed it out into a pandas DataFrame
-Authenticate and connect to a BigQuery database
-Load the random joke data into a BigQuery table
-Deploy the script via schedule library to run every 2 minute, thus getting a new joke into our database every 2 minutes.
